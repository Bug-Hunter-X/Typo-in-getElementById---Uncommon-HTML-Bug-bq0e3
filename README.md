This repository demonstrates a common, yet uncommonly caught, error in HTML.  The bug lies in a simple typo within the JavaScript code that interacts with the DOM.  The solution highlights the correct way to access DOM elements using the standard `getElementById` method and includes robust error handling to prevent runtime errors.  The focus is not just on fixing the typo, but also on improving the overall robustness of the code.  This example illustrates the importance of careful attention to detail, especially in method names, when working with JavaScript and HTML.
